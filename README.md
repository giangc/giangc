ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @giangc / Giang Nguyen

ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in software technology and design that solves business problem: Cloud, Software Architecture and Automation. For many reasons, I don't force myself to be a '10 years expert' into a single domain, I let the journey drive me. And I treat myself as one cohesive knowledge body and working toward one knowledge body.

I think communication is the most important skill. Speak and Listen, Write and Read.

* (how I passed kubernetes CKA exam)[https://medium.com/@crystaltech/a-laymans-note-on-cka-exam-f5c52d66128c]
